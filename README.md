# Subscene Profile Downloader
I created this script to batch download a subscene profile's subtitles.

## Setup and Run
1- Clone the repo or download it.  
2- Run CMD and `cd` to the root folder of the cloned repo.  
3- Install the required python modules by running `python pip install -r requirements.txt`.  
If that didn't work then run `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` instead.  
4- Run `python main.py`.
5- enter the profile's ID. For example, [this profile's id](https://subscene.com/u/1077832) is 1077832.

## General Notes
- You should install latest version of Chrome. (version 111.0.5563.65).
